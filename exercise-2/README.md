# Exercise 2 - Reflected XSS

Browse to http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/start.mvc#attack/611366032/900/5 (login using guest/guest if you havent already). You should now be on Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) stage 5.

The goal of the exercise is to login as Larry ( pw: larry) and find a reflected XSS-vulnerability in the search-page.

Hints:
- Javascript ````<script>Code goes here</script>````
- Alert is ````alert()````

For added points - add some html-code to the search page using a search.
