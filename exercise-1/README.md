# Exercise 1 - Registration form

In this exercise, we will be using the registration form at Hack-yourself-first. 
We will take the form apart and study how it works, Start by looking at the form, and see if you can exploit it in order to discover different security weaknesses or flaws. 

:bulb: To avoid registering your actual email, you can freely use mailinator.com. If you register with e.g. `something@mailinator.com`, you can visit their webpage and type "something" to view received emails for that name. We recommend this instead of using your own private email address.

:pencil2: Find out where the request sends your form data.
