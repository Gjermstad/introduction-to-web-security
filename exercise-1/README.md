# Exercise 1 - Registration form

In this exercise, we will be using the registration form at Hack-yourself-first. 
We will take the form apart and study how it works, Start by looking at the form, and see if you can exploit it in order to discover different security weaknesses or flaws. 

:bulb: To avoid registering your actual email, you can freely use mailinator.com. If you register with e.g. `something@mailinator.com`, you can visit their webpage and type "something" to view received emails for that name. We recommend this instead of using your own private email address.

:pencil2: Go to [hack-yourself-first.com](https://hack-yourself-first.com/). Register an account using Mailinator. 

:question: Register an account using the mailinator-service. Look at the email you receive. What major vulnerability can you spot right off the bat?

:pencil2: Make yourself familiar with the developer tools in Chrome or Firefox.

Right-click an element on the site, and click `Inspect element`. 
You will also need functionality to look at the source code of the page later on. This can be done by right clicking on the page, and selecting `View page source`.

Open the `Network`-pane in your developer tools, and look at the requests and responses that are passed between your browser and the site. 

Open the `Storage`-pane (Firefox) / `Application`-pane (Chrome) and take a look at your cookies

When you feel comfortable using your browser, looking at the traffic and examining your cookies, go on to the next exercise where we will get our hands dirty.
