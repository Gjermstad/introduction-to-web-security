# Using GitHub Codespaces with this repository

See [GitHub Codespaces overview](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview) if you want to learn more about GitHub Codespaces.

## Read this first

CodeSpaces gives you 60 hours of free use per month for personal GitHub accounts. You will be notified by email when you have used 75%, 90%, and 100% of your included quotas. 

When a personal account has used all of either the included storage or compute usage (whichever is reached first), and has no spending limit configured, use of GitHub Codespaces will be blocked. You must set up a payment method and a spending limit to continue using GitHub Codespaces during the current billing month.
