# Exercise 4 - SQL Injection

SQL Injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to change queries that an application makes to a database. This can be done by interfering with input sent from the user, which can be interpreted by the server as valid SQL. 

An attacker can retrieve data they are unauthorized to see, as well as performing destructive actions such as deleting or modifying your data.
