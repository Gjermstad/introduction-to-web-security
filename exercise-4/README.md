# Exercise 4 - HttpOnly

Browse to http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/start.mvc#attack/68584332/900 (login using guest/guest if you havent already). You should now be on Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - HttpOnly Test.

The goal of this exercise is to get to know the http-only header and how it affects JavaScripts ability to read cookies. 

Just toggle the yes/no and submit - compare the requests/responses in burpsuite and discuss with your side-man/woman. Also use web developer tools ( F12 ) and press storage - expand on cookies and see how Firefox displays cookiet with httpOnly set/not set.
